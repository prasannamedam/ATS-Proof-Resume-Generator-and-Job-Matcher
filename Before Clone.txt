Before clone:
Read me:
front end part:
first create project in VS ==> create two folders Front end and server =>> in front end folder create client folder ==> in client folder install react => you install using vite ==> src folder will be created in client automatically when react is installed ==> create folders components, pages,context in src folder => add respective uploaded files in folders as per git. ==> add uploaded index.css/ or you can copy paste the content for css . i would recommend creating another .css and copying the content from the git. ==> replace content of app.js and index.js as per git uploaded files with same name.

Backend part :
first create another folder name server in project => run these commands in powershell in server folder==> npm init -y => npm install cors mongoose dotenv express => these will install your dependencies. => create .env files where you place your MONGO_URL as you will get when you sign up on mongodb atlas and create cluster.=> reference is already use in index.js you have place your url in .env file.
==> create folder named models and routes in server folder add uploaded respective files in it.

this is our both frontend and backend done ..
Now you have to make changes in package.json in server. in "scripts" part remove whats there and add "start": "node index.js"

Now while running code in terminal first run backend part ==> cd server ==> npm start ==> backend is connected ==> make sure get message Mongodb connected.

Now open another powershell terminal ==> cd frontend => cd client ==> npm start => this will render output on browser automatically.
